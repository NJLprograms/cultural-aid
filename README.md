Cultural Aid is a web application aimed at mending culture shock by allowing users to feed it pictures to which it will respond with contextual data. This project is a work in progress.
  
# Technology Stack üñ•

</br>The framework used is Next.js. <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Learn more here!</a>

Code is written in Typescript. Typescript is a superset of Javascript. <strong>This means that writing valid Javascript in a typescript file <em>(.ts extension)</em> is the same as it would be in a javascript file <em>(.js extension)</em>.</strong> Typescript gives the developers a better experience with Intellisense and normalizes data schemas through a full stack application.
